  ""abstract"": ""  Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in\nnon-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the\nstandard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of\nneutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the\nprocess of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first\nexperiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence\nof possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing\nefforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana\nexperiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed\nstudy of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.\n"",
