  ""abstract"": ""  We combine classical methods of combinatorial group theory with the theory of\nsmall cancellations over relatively hyperbolic groups to construct finitely\ngenerated torsion-free groups that have only finitely many classes of conjugate\nelements. Moreover, we present several results concerning embeddings into such\ngroups.\n  As another application of these techniques, we prove that every countable\ngroup $C$ can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a group $N$,\nwhere $N$ is a finitely generated group having Kazhdan's property (T) and\ncontaining exactly two conjugacy classes.\n"",
