  ""abstract"": ""  We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a\ntwo-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two\nelectrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field\ntheory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong\ncouplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location\nof phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange\ncoupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive\nthe system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital\nsusceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce\nan orbital selective Mott state.\n"",
