  ""abstract"": ""  Given an orientable weakly self-dual manifold X of rank two, we build a\ngeometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C) as a naturally defined algebra\nL of endomorphisms of the space of differential forms of X. We provide an\nexplicit description of Serre generators in terms of natural generators of L.\nThis construction gives a bundle on X which is related to the search for a\nnatural Gauge theory on X. We consider this paper as a first step in the study\nof a rich and interesting algebraic structure.\n"",
