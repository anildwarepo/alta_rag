  ""abstract"": ""  The shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nue\nhas been measured in a model independent analysis and compared with theoretical\ncalculations. We use 75 fb(-1) of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the\nPEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding decay branching fraction,\nrelative to the decay D0 --> K- pi+, has also been measured to be RD = BR(D0\n--> K- e+ nue)/BR(D0 --> K- pi+) = 0.927 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.012. From these\nresults, and using the present world average value for BR(D0 --> K- pi+), the\nnormalization of the form factor at q2=0 is determined to be f+(0)=0.727 +/-\n0.007 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic,\nand from external inputs, respectively.\n"",
