  ""abstract"": ""  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles\ntheory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well\naccounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from\npure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite\ninterlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive\ninteractions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals\ndensity functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The\nuse of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal\nparameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and\npotassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding\nseparation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are\nreported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are\nreported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal\napproach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.\n"",
