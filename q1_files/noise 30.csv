  ""abstract"": ""  We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation\neffects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime\nwhere itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations\nand static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several\ninteresting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the\nspectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral\nfunction for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since\nthe optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral\nfunction, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low\nfrequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double\nkondo peak arrangement\n"",
