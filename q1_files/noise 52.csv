  ""abstract"": ""  We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including\ninteracting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean\nquantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the\nisometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either\nself-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the\nself-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a\nunitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian\nmanifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose\nLorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space.\n"",
