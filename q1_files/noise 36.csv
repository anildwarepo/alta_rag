  ""abstract"": ""  The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly\nused in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic\nbehaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive\nfeedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a\ngeneral multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number\nof positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show\nanalytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n\nis even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1\nsteady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single\nlevels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for\nparameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions,\nthere are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the\nstandard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one\nsteady state.\n"",
