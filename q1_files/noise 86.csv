  ""abstract"": ""  We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of\none-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles\nthat are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds.\nParticles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles\ncollide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass\nand speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the\nasymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\\to \\infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the\nnumber of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our\nmain result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on\nthe discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states\nthat the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of\nneighbor particles.\n"",
