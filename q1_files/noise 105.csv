  ""abstract"": ""  We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of\nsets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by\nsymplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of\nrigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment\nmaps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following\nthe works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly\nsingular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth\nfunctions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity\nof the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the\nFloer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.\n"",
