  ""abstract"": ""  We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite\nbackground in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an\nintegrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear\nSchr\\\""{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the\ninverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The\nresulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under\nvanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit\nmanner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into\ntwo kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies\nthe ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the\npolar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton\ncollisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a\ncollision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the\nprevious studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and\ndark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of\nthe multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.\n"",
