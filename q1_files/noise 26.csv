  ""abstract"": ""  Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from\nN-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent\nsingularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free\nnetworks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a\nmeta-fractal or \""Sky\"" when it is interpreted as the \""strut constant\"" (S) of an\nensemble of octahedral vertex figures called \""Box-Kites\"" (the fundamental\nbuilding blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or \""recipes\""\nprovide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context\nof Wolfram's Class 4 complexity.\n"",
