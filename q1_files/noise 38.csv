  ""abstract"": ""  We present a review of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is a\ngeneral method to simulate light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. We\nput the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, taking\nthe viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for the\nelectric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects,\nthe latter being of critical importance for any practical application of the\nmethod. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of light\nscattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed.\n"",
