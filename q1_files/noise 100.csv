  ""abstract"": ""  The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms\nof the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be\nunderstood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain\nconstraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n\nkinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii)\nHandles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black\nhandles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an\nexterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is\nshown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from\nthat with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat\nspace-times.\n"",
