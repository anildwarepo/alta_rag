  ""abstract"": ""  We present recent advances in understanding of the ground and excited states\nof the electron-phonon coupled systems obtained by novel methods of\nDiagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic Optimization, which enable the\napproximation-free calculation of Matsubara Green function in imaginary times\nand perform unbiased analytic continuation to real frequencies. We present\nexact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function\nand optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich\npolaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and\ninteracting with phonons hole in the t-J model.\n"",
