  ""abstract"": ""  In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden\nMarkov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on\ntwo-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode\nsequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\\Theta(m\\log n)$,\nwithout a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.\nClassical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for\nanalysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and\nfor continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance\nof the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both\nsimulated and real DNA sequences.\n"",
