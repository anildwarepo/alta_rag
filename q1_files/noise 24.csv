  ""abstract"": ""  The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized\nstripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved\nBrillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that\nthe confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the\nlateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic\nmagnetization takes place at the edges.\n  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a\nwaveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction\nwith the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The\nexperiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the\nshape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the\nconfinement.\n"",
