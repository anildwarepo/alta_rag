  ""abstract"": ""  Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of\nmodular forms on $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extend\nthe result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight\non $\\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations among\nFourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications\nwe obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of\nEisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain point\nare also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of\nSiegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.\n"",
