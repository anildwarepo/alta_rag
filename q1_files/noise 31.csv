  ""abstract"": ""  We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of\nparticles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold\ndistribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In\nsimulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the\naccelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from\nthe interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set\nthe criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton\nangles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1\nmicrorad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward\nprotons at the LHC.\n"",
