  ""abstract"": ""  The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested\ndensity matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble\nin quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one)\ndistribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the\nobservable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the\n{\\em Lorentzian} path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained\ncosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological\nconstant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages\nof expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within\nthe concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the\nbounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble\nsuggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and,\nsimultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of\nthe quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.\n"",
