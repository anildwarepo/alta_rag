  ""abstract"": ""  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete\ndipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are\nbounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when\nthe latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is\nsignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.\nTherefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller\nthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical\nsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number\nof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.\n"",
