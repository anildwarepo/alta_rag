  ""abstract"": ""  We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the\ndiscrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique\nwas studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using\nmany different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with\nrefining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for\ncubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was\ndemonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were\nproven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate\nshape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.\n"",
