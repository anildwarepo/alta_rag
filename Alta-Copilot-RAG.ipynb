      "To enable a policy to archive logs in DB2, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Start the NetBackup Web UI**:\n",
      "   - Open the NetBackup web UI to begin the configuration process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Create a New Policy**:\n",
      "   - On Windows, create a new **MS-Windows** policy type.\n",
      "   - On UNIX, create a new **Standard** policy type.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Specify Policy Attributes**:\n",
      "   - Define the attributes for the policy, including the name and type.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Create a User Archive Schedule**:\n",
      "   - Navigate to the **Schedules** tab and create a **User archive schedule**.\n",
      "   - This schedule must encompass all the time periods during which DB2 can call the user exit program.\n",
      "   - Note that no backup selections list is necessary for this policy because it has a **User archive schedule**. It is not an automatic schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Specify Clients to be Backed Up**:\n",
      "   - Add the clients to be backed up. If the client is installed in a DB2 cluster, add the virtual host name to the client list.\n",
      "   - If NetBackup is installed on more than one node in the DB2 cluster, additional configuration is required. You must approve each valid auto-discovered mapping that NetBackup discovers in your environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Install Required Software**:\n",
      "   - Ensure the clients have the following installed:\n",
      "     - **DB2**\n",
      "     - **NetBackup for DB2**\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Policy Name**:\n",
      "   - Note the name of the policy. When configuring the `db2.conf` file, specify the name of the policy created in this procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### More Information on User Archive Schedules:\n",
      "- **Purpose**: A **User archive schedule** is used to archive DB2 logs by coordinating with the user exit program. When NetBackup performs an archive, it deletes the online files after they are successfully backed up.\n",
      "- **Configuration**:\n",
      "  - The schedule must cover all time periods during which DB2 can call the user exit program.\n",
      "  - It is not an automatic schedule, meaning it requires manual initiation or coordination with DB2's user exit program.\n",
      "- **Usage**:\n",
      "  - The user exit program can copy archive logs to a directory (ARCDIR) for later backup by NetBackup.\n",
      "  - The **ARCFUNC COPY** command is used to copy archive logs to the ARCDIR directory.\n",
      "  - To free disk space, you can perform a user archive to archive all files in the ARCDIR directory to NetBackup volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more details on user archive schedules, refer to the NetBackup Administrator's Guide, Volume I.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- If you use the **VENDOR method** to back up archive log files, you do not need to perform this procedure.\n",

For example, to prevent interference with normal daytime operations, you can schedule your database backups to occur only at night.Multiplexed backups and restoresNetBackup for DB2 lets you take advantage of NetBackup's multiplexing capabilities. Multiplexing directs multiple data streams to one backup device, thereby reducing the time necessary to complete the operation.Transparent DB2 and regular file system backup and restore operationsAll backups and restores run simultaneously and transparently without any action from the NetBackup administrator.The database administrator can run database backup and restore operations through NetBackup. An administrator or any other authorized user can use NetBackup to run database backups and restores.Sharing the same storage units that are used for other file backupsIt is possible to share the same devices and media that is used for other backups or to give DB2 exclusive use of certain devices and media. NetBackup for DB2 can use Media Manager, disk, and Media Server Deduplication Pool (MSDP) storage units.Centralized and networked backup operationsFrom the NetBackup primary server, you can schedule database backups or start them manually for any client. The DB2 databases can also reside on hosts that are different from the devices on which NetBackup stores the backups.User interfacesNetBackup web UIA NetBackup administrator can start backup or restore operations for DB2 from the NetBackup user interface on the primary server.A database administrator can also use the IBM DB2 control center or command-line processor to start user-directed backup and restore operations.Parallel backup and restore operationsNetBackup for DB2 supports the parallel backup and restore capabilities of DB2. For example, this permits the user to run more than one tape device at a time for a single DB2 backup or restore. This usage can reduce the time necessary to complete the operation.CompressionCompression increases backup performance over the network and reduces the size of the backup image that NetBackup writes to the storage unit.Database delete requests accepted and processedDatabase delete requests are accepted and processed. When NetBackup receives a delete image request, it searches the NetBackup catalog. If the image is found and it is not on a legal hold, the image is removed from the NetBackup catalog.\\\"}, {\\\"summary\\\": \\\"The document outlines the main features of NetBackup for DB2, including media and device management, scheduling facilities for automatic backups, multiplexed backups and restores, and support for transparent operations.

NetBackup for DB2 topics use the terms \\\\\\\"user exit\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"VENDOR\\\\\\\" to differentiate the methods.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t shows the DB2 syntax you can use to specify these methods within DB2. It indicates the term that the DB2 for NetBackup uses to describe each method. Setting used with \\\\\\\"user exit\\\\\\\" Setting used with \\\\\\\"VENDOR\\\\\\\"Database configuration parameters USEREXIT and LOGRETAIN are not valid in DB2 Version 10.1 and later. Instead, LOGARCHMETH1 sets the user exit program settings.When VENDOR is used, archive logs are backed up by means of the NetBackup for DB2 vendor library. The full specification for this archive log method is as follows:On Windows: LOGARCHMETH1=VENDOR:install_path\\\\\\\\NetBackup\\\\\\\\bin\\\\\\\\nbdb2.dll\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tOn UNIX: LOGARCHMETH1=VENDOR:/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/library\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tFor library, specify an operating system-specific library.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tWhen a user exit program is used, archive logs are backed up by means of the NetBackup for DB2 user exit program.

      "Before installing NetBackup for DB2, ensure that your operating system and platform are compatible with the NetBackup for DB2 agent. You can verify this by visiting the NetBackup compatibility list site: [http://www.netbackup.com/compatibility](http://www.netbackup.com/compatibility). Additionally, ensure that the DB2 server software is installed and operational, and that one or more DB2 instances exist. In a DB2 EEE environment, install the NetBackup client software on every node and client that DB2 uses. [section: v14758723]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Verify Licensing\n",
      "Ensure that the primary server has a valid license for NetBackup for DB2 and any NetBackup options or add-ons. For a NetBackup cluster, a valid license for NetBackup for DB2 must exist on each node where the NetBackup server resides. The NetBackup for DB2 agent is installed with the NetBackup client software, and no separate installation is required. [section: v16144611]\n",

      "Determine the method for archiving DB2 log files. DB2 supports archiving its log files through a user exit program or a vendor library. NetBackup for DB2 provides both methods. The DB2 syntax for specifying these archive log methods differs depending on the DB2 version. For example, in DB2 Version 10.1 and later, LOGARCHMETH1 sets the user exit program settings, while VENDOR is used for archive logs backed up by the NetBackup for DB2 vendor library. [section: v15491710]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Specify the DB2 Home Path (UNIX Systems)\n",
      "On UNIX systems, specify the DB2 home path. After installing NetBackup with a valid license for NetBackup for DB2, run the `db2_config` script located in `/usr/openv/netbackup/bin`. This script gathers additional information about your DB2 environment. You need to supply the home path for the database instance (e.g., `/home/db2inst1`) and add any other database instances as needed. [section: v15493450]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Add a New Database Instance\n",
      "Adding new DB2 instances differs between Windows and UNIX systems:\n",
      "- **Windows**: The NetBackup for DB2 installation software writes the user exit program (`db2uext2.exe`) to the DB2 installation location. If you reinstall or move the DB2 installation, manually copy `db2uext2.exe` from the NetBackup location into the DB2 location.\n",

      "     - If the backup policy includes the cluster name (or virtual name).\n",
      "     - If the NetBackup client is installed on more than one node in the cluster, the virtual name must be mapped to each node.\n",
