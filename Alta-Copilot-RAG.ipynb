      "\n",
      "1. **Verify the installation prerequisites**:\n",
      "   - Before starting the installation, ensure that all prerequisites are met. This includes checking the compatibility of your system with NetBackup for DB2. You can verify compatibility by visiting the following link: [NetBackup Compatibility](http://www.netbackup.com/compatibility).\n",
      "   - [section: v14758586]\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verify that the primary server has a valid license for NetBackup for DB2 and any NetBackup options or add-ons**:\n",
      "   - Ensure that the primary server has a valid license for the NetBackup for DB2 agent. This is crucial as the agent is installed with the NetBackup client software, and no separate installation is required. For a NetBackup cluster, a valid license must exist on each node where the NetBackup server resides.\n",

      "   - Change to the following directory: `/usr/openv/netbackup/bin`\n",
      "   - Run the following script: `./db2_config`\n",

If a user specified a catalog name during a backup, there are certain setup actions you must follow during restore operations. Follow the following options for use in a Windows and UNIX environment.If you use a non-root service user account, specific access must be allowed for that user when you add files to the /usr/openv/netbackup/db/altnames directory. The service user account must have full access to these files through the ownership or group and the permissions. For example, if the service user is svcname and its group is srvgrp, the file can have permissions of 400.

If you select objects within the database, you cannot select objects within other databases at the same time.PartitionThe partition is the highest selectable DB2 object. A partition represents a collection of storage within a database in which tablespaces are stored. Partitions contain tablespaces and log folders. Within a database, you can select one or more partitions.DB2 EEE/DPF environments generally consist of multiple partitions. Other DB2 UDB environments consist of a single partition, which is usually represented as partition zero (0).The display includes only partitions that reside on the same NetBackup client.

In environments with VENDOR in effect, NetBackup ignores the information that pertains to these commands.Whether to specify ARCFUNC SAVE or ARCFUNC COPY depends on the amount of user intervention you intend to provide.If you specify ARCFUNC SAVE, NetBackup backs up the archive logs according to the policy and schedule you specify.If DB2 later issues a ROLLFORWARD request, the user exit program looks for the archive logs on a backup volume. At restoration time, no user intervention is required. The sequential recovery can be slow if there are numerous, large log files.If you specify ARCFUNC COPY, NetBackup copies the archive logs to the location that is specified on the ARCDIR statement in the db2.conf file.The disk to which the archive logs are copied eventually fills with archived log files. Most users want to configure a user archive schedule so they can archive the entire ARCDIR directory to NetBackup volumes.This method requires some user intervention during the recovery.
